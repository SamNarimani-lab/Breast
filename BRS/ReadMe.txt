This repository focuses on Breast Region Segmentation (BRS), an essential preprocessing step for small datasets prior to Breast Lesion Segmentation. We evaluated seven well-known deep learning models to segment the entire breast region. Among these, FCNResNet50 emerged as the most competitive, offering a strong balance between performance and environmental sustainability due to its minimal carbon footprint. This model was subsequently selected for further training and performance enhancement.
